# Webscraper

I have created this as an opportunity to explore using JavaScript and Electron for the first time.

Note: if the website HTML structure changes, this could stop the webscraper from fetching data correctly.

The purpose is to scrape data from a website (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and do some data processing, then to redisplay the data in a different format inside a desktop application using Electron. I also wanted to play around with some css styling and options for filtering the data.
